<p><font size="4" color="white">Once two friends called harry and garry came to a city to earn money.They went to a rich merchant for a job.<br>
The merchant gave each of them a cane basket and pointing towards a well in his garden said,"take these basket<br>
and draw water from the well till dusk."<br>
<br>
<p align="left">Harry thought it foolish to draw water in a cane basket.So,he slept.On the other hand,Garry kept working.<br>
After few hours,when he drew the basket up,he saw some gold coins in the basket.<br>
<br>
<p align="left">He took them to the merchant who rewarded him and gave him a job too.Harry went away ashamed.
